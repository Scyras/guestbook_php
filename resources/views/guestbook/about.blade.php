    <h1>About the Developer</h1>
    <p>
        <br/>
        <br/>Name: <b>Phillip</b>
        <br/>
        <br/>For the last 16 years or more, I've been a desktop software developer.
        <br/>
        <br/>For the Millennials out there:
        <br/>Desktop software is software that does not require the internet to function.
        <br/>I know... a world without google, youtube, without cellphones that could fit in your pocket, Developers did things the hard way.
        <br/>
        <br/>Amazingly: The world is moving away from Desktop and so I've decided to try this internet development thing.
        <br/>
        <br/>After 5 days (yes DAYS) of Php, it was lot like my first Shark dive.
        <br/>No cage, no rules, scary, murky and exciting, just remember the basics and take it easy... OH MY GOD IT LOOKING AT ME!.
        <br/>Part of you wants never try anything new ever again, another part goes "See, its not so bad", and a tiny part is hunched up cry and laughing in corner.
        <br/>Since then, I've had 52 scuba dives.
        <br/>
        <br/>Its scary, no terrifying, at first but the more you practice the more you improve.
        <br/>
